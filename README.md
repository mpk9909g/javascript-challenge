## Javascript-challenge

**HW 14 javascript-challenge**

**WAKE UP SHEEPLE!** This homework assignment required us to take a dataset on UFO sightings, create a table on a webpage, and configure filters to search the table on the webpage. Javascript was relied upon heavily to complete this task.

A git repository called ``javascript-challenge`` was created for this assignment

The repository contains two folders, **UFO-level-1** and **UFO-level-2**,  corresponding to two challenges in the assignment.

Each folder contains an index.html file for the website landing page, and a folder called **static**.  Inside the static folder are subfolders for javascript, css, and image files.  The Javascript files include an ``app.js`` file (containing the main javascript code), and a ``data.js`` file (containing the ufo data).

## UFO Level 1
The level-1 challenge involved automating the table, and a date search.  The table consists of columns for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comments.  A date form is included in the  HTML document, and the JavaScript code in the ``app.js`` file handles for events and searches through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.


## UFO Level 2
The level-2 challenge involved adding additional filters to use to search the data.  This refurbished page includes filters for 5 criteria:

1.	``date/time``
2.	``city``
3.	``state``
4.	``country``
5.  ``shape``
